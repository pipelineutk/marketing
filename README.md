In this repo contains logo design ideas as well as potential flyers for use by the Pipeline student organization.

## logo elements

Using these principles in creation of logo: 

- Pipeline was named after the leaky pipeline for women's advancement in STEM
- physical pipelines are thought of as very industrial, so very neat bends, rounds, etc.
    - physical pipelines have connections, bolting that anchor in place
- Pipeline is focused on Women in STEM. thinking of basic greek female identity.
    - thinking of using the physical connection as the typical clean end of it, but the connection itself has a bridge element in it.
- STEM is made of 4 sub-domains (that make up its name after all)
    - but don't like typical generalizations for STEM logos, though I do feel they are probably the best, given alternatives.
    - I'm thinking of showing the four together, but not limit to what they are. - circles can be a good representation.
